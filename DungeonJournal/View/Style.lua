--  View/Style.lua -- how the Dungeon Journal looks: every colour, size, spacing and icon,
--  in one place (ns.Journal.Style). Change the look here; the files that draw it read these.
--
--  Names end in what they hold: _CODE a colour escape ("|cffff8000"), _RGB a colour table
--  { r, g, b } (0-1). The theme's own colours (T.fg, T.muted, T.accent...) come from the
--  addon's theme instead; they are read when a row is made, so a theme change shows after
--  a /reload. Sizes are in pixels at the addon's UI scale.

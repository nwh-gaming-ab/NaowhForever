"""The game client's own tables for WoW Forever, from wago.tools.

wago.tools publishes every table (DB2) of each game build as CSV, and can apply the hotfixes
Blizzard has pushed for that build: items added after the build was cut (Forever's Darkspear
Raiders and Theramore rewards, most of the Brood of Nozdormu's) are only in the hotfixes.
Its builds API lists every build it has, by product; Forever's builds come under more than
one product name (wow_classic_beta, wow_cn_beta), so a Forever build is told apart by its
version instead: 1.60 and up, where the classic game is 1.15.

BUILD is the build the Journal's data is read from: Tools/watch_build.py (daily, in
.github/workflows/daily-watch.yml) moves it on when a newer one is out. Used by
Tools/build_factions.py and Tools/watch_build.py.
